* Attach points to a coordinate system
- and generate facilities to convert them to v3

* Attach more semantics to v3 to make for points and directions
- and apply to other coordinate systems

* Support relative coordinate systems (relative to the canonical one)

* follow a path of points, with a local coordinate system

* mirroring
